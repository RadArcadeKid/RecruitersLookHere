# RecruitersLookHere
This is a repository full of various small code snippets and projects, mostly serving as a small showcase of my coding abilities on basic interview questions common in the software development industry.

This is primarily in:
  - C++
  - Python (3)


Although please that I am also familiar with other languages such as Javascript, Scala, YAML, HTML+CSS, and several others!


*These are generic interview questions. Any and all questions and code showcased here is not knowingly taken from any specific company or set of interview questions.*
