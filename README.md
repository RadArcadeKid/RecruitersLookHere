# RecruitersLookHere
This is a repository full of various small code snippets and projects, mostly serving as a small showcase of my coding abilities on basic interview questions common in the software development industry. All of this is my own code by design, please note the use of efficiency and industry-standard commenting and readable code. 

These projects are primarily in:
  - C++
  - Python (3)


Although please that I am also familiar with other languages such as Javascript, Scala, YAML, HTML+CSS, and several others!


*These are generic interview questions. Any and all questions/projects showcased here is not knowingly taken from any specific company or set of interview questions.*
